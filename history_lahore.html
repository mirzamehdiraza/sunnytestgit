              <blockquote>
                <p class="style2"><b>History:</b></p>
                <p class="style1">Lahore is the second largest city in   Pakistan with a population of roughly 8.5 million. The traditional capital of   Punjab for a thousand years, it had been the cultural center of Northern India   extending from Peshawar to New Delhi. This preeminent position it holds in   Pakistan as well. The people of Lahore, when they want to emphasize the   uniqueness of their town say "Lahore is Lahore". Lahore is the city of poets,   artists and the center of film industry. It has the largest number of   educational institutions in the country and some of the finest gardens in the   continent.</p>
                <p class="style1">Apart from being the cultural and   academic centre of the country, Lahore is the showcase for Mughal architecture   in Pakistan. For more than 200 years, beginning from about 1524 AD, Lahore was a   thriving cultural centre of the great Mughal Empire. Mughal Emperors beautified   Lahore, with palaces, gardens and mosques. &nbsp;</p>
                <p class="style1">The original citadel city is   situated one mile to the south of the river Ravi, and some 23 miles from the   eastern border of the Punjab district. The walls of the city, when they were   still standing, gave it a shape of a parallelogram. The total area inside the   walls encompassed roughly 461 acres of land. The city is slightly elevated above   the plain, and has a high ridge within it, running east and west on its northern   side. The whole of this elevated ground is composed of the accumulated debris of   many centuries.</p>
                <p class="style1">The origins of Lahore are shrouded   in the mists of antiquity but Lahore is undoubtedly ancient. Legend has it that   it was founded about 4,000 years ago by Loh, son of Rama, the hero of the Hindu   epic, the Ramayana. Reminiscence of its hoary past are the remains of a   subterranean temple attributed to Rama, in the northern part of the Royal Fort.   Historically, it has been proved that Lahore is at least 2,000 years old.   Hieun-tasng, the famous Chinese pilgrim has given a vivid description of Lahore   which he visited in the early parts of the 7th century AD. Lying on   the main trade and invasion routes to South Asia, Lahore has been ruled and   plundered by a number of dynasties and hordes. Muslim rule began here when   Qutub-ud-din Aibak was crowned in Lahore in 1206 and thus became the first   Muslim Sultan of the subcontinent. It waxed and waned in importance during the   Sultanate. However, it touched the zenith of its glory during the Mughal rule   from 1524 to 1752. The Mughals, who were famous as builders, gave Lahore some of   its finest architectural monuments, many of which are extinct today.</p>
                <p class="style1">It was Akbar's capital for 14 years   from 1584 to 1598. He built the massive Lahore Fort on the foundations of a   previous fort and enclosed the city within a red brick wall boasting 12 gates.   Jahangir and Shah Jahan (who was born in Lahore) extended the fort, built   palaces and tombs, and laid out gardens. Jahangir loved the city and he and his   wife Noor Jahan are buried at Shahdara. The last of the great Mughals, Aurangzeb   (1658-1707), gave Lahore its most famous monument, the great Badshahi Masjid   (Royal Mosque) and the Alamgiri gateway to the fort.</p>
                <p class="style1">During the eighteenth century, as   Mughal power dwindled, there were constant invasions by the likes of Nadir Shah   and Ahmed Shah Abdali. Lahore was a suba, a province of the Empire, governed by   provincial rulers with their own court. These governors managed as best they   could though for much of the time it must have been a rather thankless task to   even attempt. The 1740s were years of chaos and between 1745 and 1756 there were   nine changes of governors. Invasions and chaos in local government allowed bands   of warring Sikhs to gain control in some areas. Lahore ended up being ruled by a   triumvirate of Sikhs of dubious distinction for about 30 years before Maharaja   Ranjit Singh came to power in 1799 and finally managed to bring order for 40 odd   years. He tried to bring back a glimmer of Mughal glory by renovating some of   the monuments while adding some of his own. Because of scarcity of building   material, marble and semi-precious gems were appropriated from the existing   buildings to be used in the Sikh projects all over the empire. In general   however, the Sikh period was bad news for the protection of ancient buildings.   Some survived, misused and knocked about a bit and a few new ones were added.   Nevertheless, descriptions of Lahore during the early 19th century refer to it   as a "melancholy picture of fallen splendor."</p>
                <p class="style1">The British, following their   invasion of Lahore in 1849, added many buildings in "Mughal-Gothic" style as   well as some shady bungalows and gardens. Early on, the British tended to build   workaday structures in sites like the Fort, though later they did start to make   an effort to preserve some ancient buildings. The Lahore Cantonment, the British   residential district of wide, tree-lined streets and white bungalows set in   large, shaded gardens, is the prettiest cantonment in Pakistan. Since   Independence in 1947, Lahore has expanded rapidly as the capital of Pakistani   Punjab. </p>
                <p class="style1">Today, Lahore can be best described   as a city that is just so wonderful, so very fabulous, that every nook and   corner of the city speaks of a certain vibrance, a certain zeal, a spirit of   life, which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Perhaps it is the   maturity of the city, which manifests itself in the various parts of Lahore. It   is present in the monuments, in the bazaars, in the old buildings lining the   Mall, or in the vast expanses of the sports grounds in the Cantonment. But most   vividly, this great <em>Lahori spirit</em> is visible in the people of Lahore, the <em>Zinda dilan-e-Lahore</em> (The Zealous of Lahore). </p>
                <p class="style1">Lahore is a city of culture, of   history, of an unrivaled charm that sets it apart from every other city on   earth. It seems that great <em>Lahori spirit</em> has invaded and saturated this   city over the centuries, to the effect that Lahore today is not just a city, not   just a place in one corner of this planet, but a whole universe in itself; what   to say of similarities to other Mughal cities...the average Lahori is that same   old Mughal prince of bygone ages, one only has to get to know him. There is an   old saying, that in every Lahori, there is a Mughal prince. </p>
                <p class="style1">The description of the pure Lahori   spirit conveniently evades the mind, adding to the mysteries of this city. At   best, it can be said that this spirit pervades the citadel and the slum alike.   The city has known ages of cultural, intellectual, musical, literary and   humanistic evolution, which has consequently led to the fermentation and over   fermentation of this rich brew we call Lahore. Few cities of the world, if   indeed any, can lay claim to such a wonderful past or present. </p>
                <p class="style1">All this makes Lahore a truly   rewarding experience. The buildings, the roads, the trees and the gardens, in   fact the very air of Lahore is enough to set the mind spinning in admiration.   Many a poet has written about this phenomenon one experiences in the environs of   Lahore. When the wind whistles through the tall trees, when the twilight floods   the beautiful face of the Fort, when the silent canal lights up to herald the   end of another chapter in history, the Ravi is absorbed in harmony, mist fills   the ancient streets, and the <em>havelis</em> come alive with strains of classical   music, the spirit of Lahore pervades even the hardiest of souls.</p>
